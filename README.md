# ‚ö° FastPath Universal API

**Bitcoin ‚áÑ Ethereum Bridge with Mathematical Proofs, Not Promises**

> üöß **ALPHA WARNING**: This is under active development. Core contracts are stabilizing but deployment setup needs completion.

## üéØ Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Core Contracts** | ‚úÖ Stable | BitcoinDeFi, SyntheticBTC, FastPathVRFVerifier |
| **Tests** | ‚úÖ Basic coverage | Foundry tests passing |
| **Deployment Scripts** | üöß Scaffolded | Need environment setup |
| **Universal RPC** | üîÆ Ready and tested, will be updated | Bitcoin JSON-RPC ‚Üí Ethereum translation |
| **Verification Demo** | ‚úÖ Live | [Proof Bundle Verifier](https://terrastake-org.github.io/proof-bundle-verifier-/proof-bundle-verifier.html) |

## üìú Historical Context

### The Canonical UTXO Pool - Bitcoin History Preserved

Our fixed 5-UTXO pool isn't arbitrary - it represents key moments in Bitcoin's history:

| UTXO | Historical Significance | Details |
|------|------------------------|---------|
| **`f4184fc...e9e16`** | **First Bitcoin Transaction**<br>Satoshi ‚Üí Hal Finney (10 BTC)<br>*Block 170* | The very first Bitcoin transaction between Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney, marking the beginning of peer-to-peer electronic cash |
| **`0437cd7...a597c9`** | **Early Coinbase**<br>50 BTC block reward<br>*Block 9* | From Bitcoin's first month of existence, representing the early mining era when block rewards were the primary coin distribution |
| **`a1075db...f5d48d`** | **Early Whale Transaction**<br>10,000 BTC transfer<br>*Block 57,043* | One of the largest early transactions, showcasing Bitcoin's capability for substantial value transfer without intermediaries |
| **`777ed67...438ce2`** | **Exchange Era**<br>500 BTC (Mt. Gox era)<br>*Block 91,812* | From the period when Bitcoin began trading on early exchanges, representing the transition from cypherpunk experiment to digital asset |
| **`c2bfb6f...8531b6`** | **Modern Era**<br>1 BTC SegWit transaction<br>*Block 481,824* | Post-SegWit activation, demonstrating Bitcoin's evolution with improved scalability and feature sets |

### Why These Specific UTXOs?

- **Historical Significance**: Each represents a milestone in Bitcoin's evolution
- **Publicly Verifiable**: All transactions are permanently recorded on Bitcoin's blockchain
- **Temporal Diversity**: Spans from 2009 to modern Bitcoin era
- **Technical Evolution**: Shows script evolution from P2PK to P2WPKH

### Security Through Transparency

The fixed pool approach provides:
- **Deterministic Verification**: No ambiguity about which UTXOs are accepted
- **Audit Trail**: Every canonical UTXO has public historical context
- **No Oracle Risk**: No dependency on real-time Bitcoin state
- **Reproducible**: Anyone can verify the merkle tree construction

*These UTXOs aren't just data points - they're pieces of Bitcoin's story, now preserved as trust anchors for cross-chain verification.*

"We speak Bitcoin in Ethereum. Your dApp talks to Bitcoin exactly like it talks to Ethereum - same calls, same tools, same developers. 
No multisig risks, no wrapped token compromises - just pure cryptographic verification with a unified interface."
